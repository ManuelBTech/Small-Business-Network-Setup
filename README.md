# Small-Business-Network-Setup
Cisco Packet Tracer project for a small business network with DHCP and security features.
# Small Business Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer

This project involves designing and configuring a small business network in Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup includes a router, a switch, multiple PCs, and an additional PC to test security features.

## Key Tasks Completed
- **Network Topology Design**: Built a functional network layout connecting a router, switch, and end devices.
- **Manual IP Configuration**: Assigned static IP addresses to PCs and confirmed connectivity with ping commands.
- **DHCP Configuration**: Set up the router as a DHCP server to dynamically assign IP addresses, simplifying network management.
- **Firewall Security**: Implemented an access control list (ACL) to block unauthorized external traffic, strengthening network security.

## Why It Matters
This project showcases foundational networking skills like IP addressing, DHCP management, and basic security practices, making it a strong addition to a portfolio for IT or networking roles.

## Files Included
- `Small_Business_Network_Setup.pkt`: The Cisco Packet Tracer project file.
- Screenshots: Topology, IP configs, DHCP tests, and ACL results.

## How to View
1. Install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Download and open the `.pkt` file to explore the network.
